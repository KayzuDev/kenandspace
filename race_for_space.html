                    A new era of space exploration has began. Since the beginning of the 21st century,
                    spaceflight companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, or Virgin Galactic were
                    created. Their principal goals are the same: develop space tourism at an affordable price and
                    create an easy access to space. However, some of their goals are different. SpaceX wants to
                    colonize Mars. Blue Origin has the goal of developing reusable rockets to serve civil, commercial
                    and defence customers and get the resources that we need from the Moon. Virgin Galactic is concentrated
                    on space tourism.

                    With the end of NASA's Space Shuttle Program in 2011, NASA decided to create the Commercial Crew Development
                    Program (or CCDev). The objective of the program was to find a way to get, and to send cargo resupply missions
                    to the International Space Station. There were three phases in this program to select the spaceflight companies
                    that will be supported by NASA.
