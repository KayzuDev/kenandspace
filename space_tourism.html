            <p>
                Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes.
                <br>
                There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital,
                <br>
                suborbital and lunar space tourism. It has been done by Roscosmos; the
                <br>
                Russian space agency, and by <a href="race_for_space.html">private spaceflight companies</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space
                <br>
                Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or
                <br>
                governmental roles to fly. However, concrete efforts to develop space tourism
                <br>
                only started in the 21st century because NASA's programs were canceled.
                <br>
                This is due to the Challenger disaster which caused the death of the passengers,
                <br>
                including one civilian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, space tourism has an impact on the environment.
                <br>
                According to a 2010 study published in Geophysical Research Letters,
                <br>
                1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location
                <br>
                would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the
                <br>
                stratosphere. This unbalance would cause the temperature to
                <br>
                decrease by about 0.4 °C in the tropics and subtropics, whereas
                <br>
                temperature at the poles would increase by between 0.2 and 1 °C.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first tourists to go to the International Space Station paid at least
                <br>
                20 million USD. On June 7, 2019, NASA announced that a trip to the International
                <br>
                Space Station is planned to be priced at 35,000 USD per day for one astronaut,
                <br>
                and an estimated 50 million USD for a roundtrip.
                <br>
                Currently, a suborbital spaceflight can cost from 250,000 USD to 30 million USD,
                <br>
                depending on the spaceflight company.
